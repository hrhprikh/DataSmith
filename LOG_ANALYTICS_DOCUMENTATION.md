- Historical trend analysis for security monitoring

### üå°Ô∏è Status Code Heatmap
- Visual representation of HTTP status codes across time periods
- 24-hour by 7-day grid showing request patterns
- Color-coded intensity mapping for easy pattern recognition
- Helps identify peak traffic times and error patterns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Live Anomaly Detection
- Real-time detection of unusual patterns
- Configurable thresholds for different anomaly types
- Severity classification (High, Medium, Low)
- Detailed descriptions of detected anomalies

## Security Analysis Features

### Threat Pattern Recognition
- **SQL Injection**: Detects common SQL injection patterns
- **XSS Attacks**: Identifies cross-site scripting attempts  
- **Path Traversal**: Recognizes directory traversal attacks

- Memory-optimized algorithms for scalability

## Best Practices

### Log File Preparation
- Ensure consistent timestamp formats
- Include IP addresses and status codes
- Maintain chronological order for timeline analysis

### Regular Monitoring
- Set up automated log analysis schedules
- Monitor anomaly detection alerts
- Review security recommendations regularly

### Integration Options
- Export results to SIEM systems
- API integration with security tools
- Custom alerting and notification setup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **File Format**: Ensure logs are in supported formats (CSV, LOG, TXT)
- **Size Limits**: Large files may require extended processing time
- **Missing Data**: Some features require specific log fields

### Performance Tips
- Use smaller file samples for initial testing
- Ensure stable internet connection for demo features
- Close unnecessary browser tabs during processing

## Future Enhancements
